* **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** ‚Äì Lowest-cost archival

---

### 3. **What is the maximum size of an object in S3?**

**Answer:**

* Up to **5 TB per object**
* Single PUT upload: **5 GB max**
* Use **Multipart Upload** for files > 5 GB

---

### 4. **How does versioning work in S3?**

**Answer:**

* Keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket
* Helps in rollback or accidental deletion recovery
* Can be enabled/disabled per bucket

---

## üöÄ **Intermediate S3 with DevOps Context**

### 5. **How do you use S3 in a CI/CD pipeline?**

**Answer:**

* Store build artifacts, config files, deployment packages
* E.g., after building a Java app with GitHub Actions or Jenkins, upload the JAR to S3 for deployment:

```bash
aws s3 cp my-app.jar s3://my-bucket/artifacts/
```

---

### 6. **How do you secure an S3 bucket?**

**Answer:**

* Block public access (recommended for most use cases)
* Use **IAM policies** for fine-grained access
* Apply **Bucket Policies** for shared access
* Use **S3 ACLs** (less common now)
* Enable **encryption** (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

---

### 7. **What is presigned URL in S3?**

**Answer:**
A time-limited URL that allows temporary access to an object without making it public.

Use case: Allow a CI/CD job or user to download/upload without exposing credentials.

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://my-bucket/myfile.zip --expires-in 3600
```

---

### 8. **What is the difference between S3 and EBS?**

**Answer:**

| Feature  | S3                   | EBS                     |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Type     | Object storage       | Block storage           |
| Use case | Backups, logs, files | EC2 volumes, DB storage |
| Access   | Via HTTP(S)/CLI/API  | Attached to EC2 only    |

---

### 9. **How can you automate S3 bucket creation with Terraform?**

**Answer:**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "ci_artifacts" {
  bucket = "devops-ci-artifacts"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "Dev"
    Team        = "DevOps"
  }
}
```

---

### 10. **How do you trigger actions based on S3 uploads?**

**Answer:**
Use **S3 Event Notifications** to trigger:

```

`--delete` will remove files in S3 not present locally (be careful).

---

### 14. **What are common DevOps mistakes with S3 and how to avoid them?**

| Mistake                  | Fix/Best Practice                               |

| Public buckets           | Use Block Public Access & IAM                   |
| No versioning            | Enable versioning to avoid data loss            |
| No lifecycle policies    | Use to auto-delete/archive unused objects       |
| Storing secrets          | Never store secrets in S3 (use Secrets Manager) |
| Manual bucket management | Automate with Terraform or CloudFormation       |

---

### 15. **What is S3 Lifecycle Policy?**

**Answer:**

* Automates **transition** (e.g., to Glacier) or **deletion**
* Helps in managing costs for logs/artifacts

```json
"Transitions": [
  {
